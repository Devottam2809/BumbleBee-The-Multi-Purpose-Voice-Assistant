# Hi, I'm BumbleBee at your service 🖐️ 
I'm a virtual assistant and I'm able to perform all the actions on a simple voice command as given by the user. I am a desktop application which actually starts at the boot time of the system. I have the following features :
1) Bootup GUI
2) Active Wake Up (Hotward Detection)
3) Google Automation
4) Youtube Automation
5) Data Base Control (fetch, add, delete,update queries)
6) Operate the windows OS
7) 2 options to lock the system   --> Face Lock   -->password Lock
8) Active Push Notifications on phone when the database is Launched
9) Voice Controlled Typing

I'm an AI model that uses speech recognition and voice synthesis to understant the user commands and then look for the matched query and speak the result.
