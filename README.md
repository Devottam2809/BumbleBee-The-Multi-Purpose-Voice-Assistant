# Hi, I'm BumbleBee at your service 🖐️  
I'm a virtual assistant capable of performing various tasks based on simple voice commands given by the user. Designed as a desktop application, I launch automatically at system boot.  

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Bootup GUI** for an enhanced user experience.
- ✅ **Active Wake Up (Hotword Detection)** to recognize voice commands efficiently.
- ✅ **Google Automation** for hands-free browsing.
- ✅ **YouTube Automation** to search and control playback.
- ✅ **Database Control** (Fetch, Add, Delete, Update queries) for seamless data management.
- ✅ **Windows OS Control** to execute commands effortlessly.
- ✅ **Dual System Locking Mechanisms:**
  - 🔒 **Face Lock** (using facial recognition)
  - 🔑 **Password Lock**
- ✅ **Push Notifications** to phone when the database is launched.
- ✅ **Voice Controlled Typing** for hands-free text input.

## 🧠 How It Works
BumbleBee utilizes **AI-based speech recognition** and **voice synthesis** to understand user commands. It then processes the query and returns the appropriate response using voice output.
