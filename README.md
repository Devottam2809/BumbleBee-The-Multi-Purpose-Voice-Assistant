# Hi, I'm BumbleBee at your service 🖐️ 
# I'm a virtual assistant and I'm able to perform all the actions on a simple voice command as given by the user. I am a desktop application which actually starts at the boot time of the system. I have the following features :
# 1) Bootup GUI
# 2) Active Wake Up (Hotward Detection)
# 3) Google Automation
# 4) Youtube Automation
# 5) Data Base Control (fetch, add, delete,update queries)
# 6) Operate the windows OS
# 7) 2 options to lock the system   --> Face Lock   -->password Lock
# 8) Active Push Notifications on phone when the database is Launched
# 9) Voice Controlled Typing

# I'm an AI model that uses speech recognition and voice synthesis to understant the user commands and then look for the matched query and speak the result.
